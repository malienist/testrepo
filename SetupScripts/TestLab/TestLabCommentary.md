## Thanks and Acknowledgements
1. ** bottkars ** - the VMXToolkit is fundamental to automating much of the VMWareWorkstation component of the build. You can find it here: https://github.com/bottkars/vmxtoolkit

## Modules
New-TestLab - used after initial download to setup lab
 
## Build Process
### Domain Controller
This is the first object to be deployed. It requires a DSC file to be transferred as the DSC pull server has not yet been developed.
